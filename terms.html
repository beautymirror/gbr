                <p>Welcome to Global Beauty Rank. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our website and services (collectively, the "Service"), provided by Digital Global Solutions LLP.</p>

                <p>Global Beauty Rank provides an AI-powered analysis of user-submitted photographs to generate a "beauty score." This score is based on an algorithmic interpretation of various facial parameters. You acknowledge that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The concept of beauty is subjective and varies across cultures and individuals.</li>
                    <li>The score provided is the result of a computer algorithm and is intended for entertainment purposes only.</li>
                    <li>The results should not be taken as a definitive or objective judgment of your appearance.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. User Data and Privacy</h2>

                <h2>4. Payments and Refunds</h2>
                <p>To receive your score, you must make a one-time payment. Please note the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> All payments are processed securely through our third-party payment processor, Stripe. We do not collect, store, or have access to your credit card information. Your payment is subject to Stripe's terms and conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Refunds:</strong> All payments for the Service are final and non-refundable. Once the analysis is performed and a score is generated, you have received the full service for which you paid.</li>
